# What is 'Very Variable Experiments'?

This is a repository of projects I worked on or am currently working on. The projects can be anything from a data wriggling  marathon (written in Stata, Python or advanced MS Excel) to curiosity of putting various OpenSource applications together (Documentation and Results Only). Sometimes, the projects are an outcome of my rage towards inequality, trying to find if data is also unfair and unjust like the rest of the world (ouch!) only to realize numbers don't give a damn :D ..Other times, they are an outcome of an attempt to level the playing field - free access to communication technologies, for eg. Either ways, feel free to re-use any of this for your mind pleasures or school projects. #engage !

# Process

A typical project involves:
1. Scoping current research/work done to address the question/observation
2. Finding and cleaning relevant data
3. If the conclusion is interesting, try to write findings. If not, just keep stuff on GitHub.


## Projects

### [Safe Streets for Pedestrians](https://github.com/PSyalPySal/VeryVariableExperiments/tree/master/PolicyPathways_SaferStreets)
Increasing number of US cities are moving towards a dense, walkable, well-connected neighborhood layout but continue to struggle with ensuring pedestrian safety - mostly because of lack of actionable insights from existing collision data. In this short project, I reviewed collision data from the city of San Diego and California highway system to assess data quality. Besides concluding 'party-at-fault' there wasn't any other useful information in these datasets. Comparing the same to dense cities like NYC, I found that collision data in San Diego and most other cities in California lack the granularities to make progress beyond establishing party-at-fault.

### [Free For All GSM Network](https://github.com/PSyalPySal/VeryVariableExperiments/tree/master/FreeGSM)
If you've always wondered what's the magical recipe behind cellphone communication, this project is for you. It employs OpenBTS,USRP, GNU Radio and Asterisk to create an independent, free GSM cellular network that you can connect to using your own cellphone.
An excellent project for education purposes or just fun. Thanks to my project partners Manasi and Guna and special thanks to Professor Mihail Sichitiu for pushing us to do this.

### [Indoor Localization using AM Radio](https://github.com/PSyalPySal/VeryVariableExperiments/tree/master/IndoorLocalizationAMRadioWaves)
'GPS Signal Lost' - everytime you hear that when entering a multi-floor parking lot in the basement, you've gotta wonder how can bypass this? This project aimed to do just that. Using three AM radio towers for triangulation, the project involved building an antenna that allowed us to provide location accuracy of up to 10 meters. Sadly, I don't have the recipe to the antenna anymore. But the MATLAB code and theory is for you'll to use. Again, thanks to my project partner John's incessant efforts and special thanks to Professor Rhee for giving us the opportunity (and the idea).

### [To EV or not to EV?]()
<p>Want to buy that Tesla but unable justify the cost when compared to your Toyota Camry? This simple excel sheet can help you make that decision. </p>
Taking average number of cars in each American household and average duration of ownership into consideration, it allows user to compare electric vehicle of choice to gasoline vehicle of choice (in terms of total costs, mileage and reliability).

### [Taxation without Representation](https://github.com/PSyalPySal/VeryVariableExperiments/tree/master/TaxationWithoutRepresentation)
<p> In United States, there is a very popular far right narrative that says illegal immigrants don't pay taxes & yet receive social security benefits. However, there is a large segment of legal, tax-paying immigrants who are not yet citizens and don't get any social security benefits (or are allowed to vote). How significant is that population? And is it time electorates took notice to cash-in this future votebank? </p>
This one is a STATA project. Using data from www.ipums.org, and national income tax bureau, this project aims to calculate the %age of state/federal tax paid by legal, non-citizen immigrants.
