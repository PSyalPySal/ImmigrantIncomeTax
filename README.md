# What is 'Very Variable Projects'?

This is a repository of projects I worked on or am currently working on. The projects can be anything from a data wriggling  marathon (written in Stata, Python or advanced MS Excel) to curiosity of putting various OpenSource projects together to see what happens (Documentation and Results Only). Sometimes, the projects are an outcome of my rage towards inequality, trying to find if data is also unfair and unjust like the rest of the world (ouch!) only to realize numbers don't give a damn :D ..Other times, they are an outcome of an attempt to level the playing field - free access to communication technologies ! Either ways, feel free to re-use any of this for your mind pleasures or school projects. #engage !

# Process

A typical project involves:
1. Scoping current research/work done to address the question/observation
2. Finding and cleaning relevant data
3. If the conclusion is interesting, try to write findings. If not, just keep stuff on GitHub.


## Projects

### [Free For All GSM Network]()
<p>If you've always wondered what's the magical recipe behind cellphone communication, this project is for you. It uses OpenBTS for base station and your own cellphone can connect to the network once you've established it.</p>
<p>An excellent project for education purposes or just fun. Thanks to my project partners Manasi and Guna and special thanks to Professor Mihail Sichitiu for pushing us to do this.</p>

### [Indoor Localization using AM Radio]()
'GPS Signal Lost' - everytime you hear that when entering a multi-floor parking lot in the basement, you've gotta wonder how can bypass this? This project aimed to do just that. Using three AM radio towers for triangulation, the project involved building an antenna that allowed us to provide location accuracy of up to 10 meters. Sadly, I don't have the recipe to the antenna anymore. But the MATLAB code and theory is for you'll to use. Again, thanks to my project partner John's incessant efforts and special thanks to Professor Rhee for giving us the opportunity (and the idea).

### [Is it smart to own an Electric Vehicle?]()
<p>As our society slowly transitions to sustainable, renewable ways of life its not easy to let go of the reliability and affordibility that gasoline vehicles represent. But are we making informed decisions when comparing Electric Vehicles (EV) with Gasoline Powered ones? Did we run the numbers to understand if EVs are indeed really expensive and non-reliable? </p>
This is a simple MS-Excel project to crunch some numbers, taking average number of cars in each American household and average duration of ownership into consideration.

### [How much tax do legal, non-citizen immigrants pay?]()
<p> In United States, there is a very popular far right narrative that says illegal immigrants don't pay taxes & yet receive social security benefits. However, there is a large segment of legal, tax-paying immigrants who are not yet citizens and don't get any social security benefits (or are allowed to vote). How significant is that population? And is it time electorates took notice to cash-in this future votebank? </p>
This one is a STATA project. Using data from www.ipums.org, and national income tax bureau, this project aims to calculate the %age of state/federal tax paid by legal, non-citizen immigrants.
