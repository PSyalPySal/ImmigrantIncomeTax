Data Analytics Projects

This is a repository of projects I worked on or currently working on. It is updated regularly. The projects are either written in Stata or Python or advanced MS Excel. Typically, I try to answer questions that interest me, using data science/statistical modelling. A typical project involves:
1. Scoping current research/work done to address the question/observation
2. Finding and cleaning relevant data
3. If the conclusion is interesting, try to write findings. If not, just keep the code on GitHub.
