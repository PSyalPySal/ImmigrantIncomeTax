# Data Analytics (and Other) Projects

This is a repository of projects I worked on or currently working on. The projects are either written in Stata or Python or Matlab or advanced MS Excel. Typically, I try to answer questions that interest me, using data science/statistical modelling. A typical project involves:
* Scoping current research/work done to address the question/observation
** Finding and cleaning relevant data
*** If the conclusion is interesting, try to write findings. If not, just keep the code on GitHub.

Sometimes, the project involves using a bunch of OpenSource projects together to come up with a useful application. In that case, there wouldn't be any code but just documentation or How-To guides.
